### Requirements

- macOS Ventura or higher (Sonoma required for fullscreen, Sequoia required for translation)
- Spotify Desktop Client (if using Spotify)

## Technical Details

- UI is built using SwiftUI.
- The lyrics are updated and fetched using Swift Concurrency and Swift Tasks
- The lyrics are stored into disk using CoreData. 
- I interface with Spotify & Apple Music using their AppleScript methods as well as by subscribing to their playback state change notifications.
- I interface with Spotify and Apple Music's AppleScript methods by using Apple's provided ScriptingBridge interface.
- I additionally use private APIs to get the currently playing Apple Music song's iTunes ID, and use MusicKit to map that to an ISRC code
- I map Apple Music songs to equivalent Spotify ID using ISRC to display Lyrics fetched from Spotify for either platform
- Lyrics are fetched from LRCLIB as a backup when Spotify fails
- I fetch the song “background color” with each lyric, and the color is used for the karaoke mode window background 
- Songs translated using Apple's Translation API. 
- The fullscreen view uses a custom mesh gradient and extracts colors from the album art using ColorKit
- Spiritual successor to LyricsX (95% more efficient, 0.1% CPU usage of Lyric Fever vs 3% of LyricsX)
- Technical write-up coming soon
